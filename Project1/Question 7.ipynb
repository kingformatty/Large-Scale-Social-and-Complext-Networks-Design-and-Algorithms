pcplus for do work great re : What to do after the high speed modem arrives Edition Apr This article applies only to Windows and and not to NT OS/ or DOS apps not run under Windows One of the unadvertised limitation of most current Windows PCs be that their RS C serial COM performance be seriously deficient Almost everyone who purchase a high speed modem V bi V PEP or HST discovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept an incoming FAX at after upgrade the modem Overrun and retry error abound even when the only active application be the datacomm or FAX program If the transfer completes at all it may take even longer than with the old bps modem There be three reason for the problem : The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters UARTs use in most PCs be primitive Ns device with single byte FIFO buffer If the operating system/driver can not read and flush each character at high interrupt rate the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and the previous one be lose DOS be a fairly single mind environment during datacomm can usually keep up Windows ca n't Windows have more operating system overhead than plain DOS and interrupt often take longer to service Overruns be much more likely than under DOS As soon a you report to your PC/modem vendor that you be lose data you may be advise that `` you need to upgrade to a `` More likely since there seem to be a conspiracy of ignorance about this issue you 'll get no useful advice at all Most of the store front and mail order source I spoke with in attempt to solve my own problem have never heard the term `` '' and many do n't even know what a UART be Even your PC have NsA UARTs and PS/ 's do or if you can upgrade your mother/COM board or add a new COM board you may STILL experience error and overrun because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM driver do n't take full advantage of the Windows be improve in this regard over but I still recommend a driver upgrade Applications like ProComm/Win which be what I use can not get around this problem by themselves If you have a modem CARD you may not have a problem a the modem part of the card can be design to be aware of the state of the UART and avoid overrun it however I would n't want to bet that the card designer be that clever and will insist on a UART if I ever buy a modem card Some modem card do n't even have conventional UARTs but if they be to work with standard Windows driver they need to simulate one Use MSD EXE below to see what the modem card be or be pretend to be The Hardware Situation The UARTs on most PC COM port be base on National Semiconductor Ns or Ns chip or megacells inside VLSI chip where you ca n't replace them You can ID the UART type on your system by run the MicroSoft diagnostic program \\\\WINDOWS\\\\MSD EXE Be sure to run it in DOS before bring up Windows The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from accurately identify a if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt The Ns UART have separate byte transmit and receive FIFOs with configurable trigger level and can run reliably at clock rate up to bps although with current modem technology there 's no point in push your luck by go over bps The have short access cycle time than the or The also have DMA capability but it be not clear that any PC driver ever use this For more technical info see National Semiconductor Application Note AN So what UART component do you have Try to locate the UART on your mother board multi function I/O card COM board or ISA/MCA modem card If you ca n't find a socketed component with the number `` '' or `` '' your COM port be probably bury in VLSI and you wo n't be able to perform a chip replacement If you can DISABLE your VLSI COM port a I chose to do you can at least add an aftermarket COM board If you have one or more socketed or chip you can buy plug in NsAFN or PCCCN low power CMOS version ICs from several supplier typically for to each The `` N '' chip be the normal pin dual in line package Other style be available but avoid any Ns chip without the `` A '' the CC be presumably all OK Early Ns chip have bug although National will reportedly exchange those of their own manufacture for free Clone chip be available from various IC maker other than National The manual for the TurboCom driver state support for the follow apparently equivalent chip : National Semiconductor : A ChipsTechnology : C Texas Instruments : tca Silicon Systems : M VLSI C TurboCom warns about the pre `` A '' Ns and Western Digital C say that problem have be report with early IBM PS/ SX and system IBM reportedly will upgrade them If you DO N'T have socketed / chip you 'll need to buy an after market COM or multi function board If this be a modem card situation you may be hose To add a new COM or multi function card you 'll need to either disable the COM/ port you be replace or re assign them to COM/ although watch out for IRQ conflict without TurboCom Although cheaper card be available in the interest of get the problem solve quickly I elect buy the Modular Circuit Technology MCT AIO card from : JDR Microdevices Samaritan Drive San Jose CA voice US voice other FAX US The MCT AIO and the `` '' be important sell for It be an bit ISA card provide : Port Type Connector Address and IRQ Comments COM DBM COM IRQ NsAFN in socket COM ribbon COM IRQ NsAFN in socket Parallel DBF LPT IRQ

IRQs on my PC so I disabled my built in VLSI base port However with the TurboCom driver below I could have set the internals a COM and use IRQ share The Software Situation Simply upgrade to UARTs will not completely solve common overrun problem The standard MS serial driver do n't take full advantage of the The Windows driver be even less capable and the Windows driver have the follow limitation : They enable only the receive FIFO and only at rate above bps They never enable the transmit FIFO which result in an interrupt rate of x during uploads They set the trigger level at byte too high it 's easy for more byte to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speed up to With a V bi modem sparse data and text can easily compress : or more suggest that a host DTE connect rate of bps would be effective The API wo n't accept rate above `` CBR_ '' The API wo n't let DOS program know there be a there and even if it do DOS program that be n't aware get little benefit from a port with the standard driver They do n't allow IRQ share for COM The BIOS do n't initialize COM properly in many system Windows provide no workaround for apps that do n't provide port speed option above bps These problem be reportedly NOT solve in Windows NT or DOS and may or may not be address in any Windows release after but before Rumors suggest they `` may

a market for it revise it to be a general purpose COM driver suite They recently upgraded it for Windows It be run time license I now have my host DTE connect rate set to bps most of my datacomm apps and I be have ZERO problem with downloads I routinely see transfer rate that exceed bps I be also use bps when link an HPLX to my PC with lossless bi directional I/O Uploads to various remote system be another matter because many host be still use antique UARTs and driver Note that be still the high rate that the Windows Port menu in Control Panel will allow in configure a COM port TurboCom get around this by allow you to specify on each port a factor that will set the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate pass through the Windows APIs and dialog box I also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enable and I suggest that you do the same Even if you only ever transfer bit ASCII data Xon/XOff be not a sufficiently reliable method of flow control The informal DEC standard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis be that the sender may transmit another yes sixteen byte after receipt of the Xoff from the receive system or device The byte FIFO in the be clearly not big enough to let u rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff A well respect datacomm engineer have inform me that the 's ca n't really do CTS/RTS all by itself in the DOS/Windows environment so use data rate above may still be risky Even with hardware flow control a with TurboCom can still experience overrun in very busy system with lot of apps run and serious swap in progress If this be your situation you may need to buy a co process COM board but this will cost you more than a /TurboCom upgrade A review of two such board and a review of TurboCom can be found in the Feb ' issue of `` Windows Sources '' magazine I suggest try a /TurboCom upgrade first and experiment with process priority and time slice if you be a `` power user '' whose thrash system still run into comm problem Closing Soapbox Comments The state of RS C serial datacomm support be an embarrassment across the computer industry Because it be the old standard I/O interface the job of design hardware and write software often seem to be assign to the least senior or low ranked engineer at computer company The design of the average serial port be at least ten year behind the state of the art In my last job with a major workstation vendor I lobby for improve serial port when they be do the initial design of a new system That family of machine be subsequently introduce with port However this be the exception Few computer company seem to have any champion for decent I/O You may a well learn what you can about serial I/O because this situation show no sign of improve soon When V FAST arrives I expect cry of outrage from Windows user world wide whose PCs `` sort of '' work today with V but will fail miserably with V FAST Without a hardware buffer UART like the and without software driver that use that UART to best advantage a V FAST modem

sequence of multiband image in the same way it deal with single image It have be grow since we first write it both by addition from u a well a a huge user contribute library Feature description HIPS be a set of image processing module which together provide a powerful suite of tool for those interested in research system development and teach It handle sequence of image movie in precisely the same manner a single frame Programs and subroutine have be developed for simple image transformation filter convolution Fourier and other transform processing edge detection and line draw manipulation digital image compression and transmission method noise generation and image statistic computation Over such image transformation program have be developed As a result almost any image processing task can be perform quickly and conveniently Additionally HIPS allows user to easily integrate their own custom routine New user become effective use HIPS on their first day HIPS feature image that be self document Each image store in the system contains a history of the transformation that have be apply to that image HIPS include a small set of subroutine which primarily deal with a standardize image sequence header and a large library of image transformation tool in the form of UNIX `` filter '' It come complete with source code on line manual page and on line documentation Host Configuration Requirements Originally developed at New York University HIPS now represent one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image processing environment currently available It run under the UNIX operating system It be modular and flexible provide automatic documentation of it action and be almost entirely independent of special equipment HIPS be now in use on a variety of computer include Vax and Microvax Sun Apollo Masscomp NCR Tower Iris IBM AT etc For image display and input driver be supply for the Grinnell and Adage Ikonas image processor and the Sun Sun Sun and Sun i console We also supply user contribute driver for a number of other framestores and windowing package Sun gfx Sun console Matrox VIP ITI IP Lexidata Macintosh II X windowing system and Iris The Hipsaddon package include an interface for the CRS It be a simple matter to interface HIPS with other frame store and we can put interested user in touch with user who have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max Video HIPS can be easily adapt for other image display device because of HIPS be machine independent Availability HIPS have proven itself a highly flexible system both a an interactive research tool and for more production orient task It be both easy to use and quickly adapt and extend to new us HIPS be supply on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format either reel to reel or Sun cartridge and come

SCSI can use both drive at once I 've get unix load on one of my pc along with windogs and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drive at one time It 's pretty ugly I just bought at Quantum for my

intrinsically well : than IDE on an ISA bus when it come to multi task OS 's when : manage data from a single SCSI hard drive On a single drive SCSI be more expensive But you bought your PC for expandibility so you 'd want to add more drive or whatever The follow be why I find SCSI intrinsically well than IDE : A partial list : You can add many different type of device and access them concurrently A SCSI device work on many different machine I have a mac and a PC at home and move hard drive between them be VERY nice with SCSI hook them up and away they go SCSI device work together well than IDE device For instance recently I add an old connor meg IDE to a maxtor meg IDE The connor MUST be setup a the slave It will work no other way On SCSI you set the address check the termination plug it in and away it go I have a problem with IDE 's mutual exclusion I notice that the time it take to switch from access drive c : to drive d : be quite long a compare to the time it take to switch from drive c : to d : on a SCSI system Under a multitasking OS this be very noticable a many thing can be go on at once One neat thing that I 've notice lately a fringe benefit have be the ability to add old almost dead drive a storage on a SCSI system with little problem we 've get a bunch of almost dead meg drive that I've add to my PC I 've now get the interface full but it do

both Terminator and Lawnmower Man those be film quality computer graphic render in software and write to film a frame at a time Each frame of computer animation for those film take hour to render on

of complex visual database at anywhere from to newly render frame per second This be a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulator for pilot training If the frame rate be too low the user notice the step of the frame a they move their head rapidly around the scene so the motion of the graphic be not smooth and contiguous Thus the graphic system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rate while render complex data representation Additionally the frame rate must be constant If the system render frame per second at one point then frame per second the next perhaps due to the scene in the new view direction be simpler than what be visible before the user can get heavily distract by the medium the graphic computer rather than focus on the data To maintain a constant frame rate the system must be able to run in real time UNIX in general do not support real time operation but Silicon Graphics have modify the UNIX kernel for it multi processor system to be able to support real time operation bypassing the usual UNIX process priority management scheme Uniprocessor system run UNIX can not fundamentally support real time operation not Sun SPARC not HP Series

GIS/remote sense flavor Feature Description Basic geometry manipulation : flip mirror rotate generalize affine Rectification : Affine nd rd th and th order model a well a a projective model warp an

High pas low pas edge enhance median generic Complex Histogram/Contrast control Layer Controller : manages up to image at a time user can extract single band from a band image or create color image by combine various individual band etc The package be design for a remote sense application it can handle VERY LARGE image and there be all kind of other software available for GIS application Host Configuration Requirements It run on Intergraph Workstations a Unix machine similar to a Sun though there be rumor there be always rumor that the software would be port to PC and possibly a Sun environment PCI A company call PCI Inc out of Richmond Hill Ontario Canada make an array of software utility for processing manipulation and use of remote sense data in eight or ten different `` industry standard '' format : LGSOWG BSQ LANDSAT and a couple of others whose title I forget The software be available in version for MS DOS Unix workstation among them HP Sun and IBM and VMS and quite possibly other platform by now I use the VMS version The `` PCI software '' consists of several classes/groups/packages of utility grouped by function but all operating on a common `` PCI database '' disk file The `` Tape I/O '' package be a set of utility program which read from the various remote sense industry tape format INTO or write those format out FROM the `` PCI database '' file this be the only package I use or know much about Other package can display data from the PCI database to one or another of several PCI support third party color display output numeric or bitmap representation of image data to an attach printer e g an Epson type dot matrix graphic printer You might be more spe cifically interested in the mathematical operation package : histo gram and Fourier analysis equalization user specify operation e g `` multiply channel by add channel and store a channel `` and God only know what all else there 's a LOT I do n't have and don't use these so ca n't say much about them you only buy the package your particular application/interest call for Each utility be control by from one to eight `` parameter `` read from a common `` parameter file '' which must be in VMS anyway in your `` default directory `` Some utility will share parameter and use the same parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confuse set up a series of operation The standard PCI environment contains a script language very similar to IBM PC BASIC but which allows you to automate the process of set up parameter for a common complicate lengthy or difficult series of utility execution In VMS I can also invoke utility independently from a DCL command procedure There's also an optional program library which allows you to write compile language program which can interface with read from/write to the PCI data structure database file parameter file The PCI software be design specifically for remote sense image but require such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the level where you can handle r s image you can figure out way to handle a few other thing a well For instance the Tape I/O package offer a utility for reading headerless multi band what Adobe PhotoShop on the Macintosh call `` raw '' data from tape in a number of different `` interleave '' order This turn out to be ideal for manipulate the graphic art industry 's `` CTT '' format would probably I have n't try handle Targa and so on Above all however you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU 'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start over It 's worth note that the PCI `` database '' file be design to contain not only `` raster '' image data but vector for overlay map information enter via digitize table land use and all manner of other information I observe

Quick C compiler in a DOS window under Windows this even I get a `` program have violate system integrity close all application exit window and restart your computer '' error Gawd I love Windows : Is there an easy way to restore everything to work order What might be some well approach You 'll probably want to delete any damage executables and reload them fresh Data file should be examine and repair What might have cause this Does the SMARTDRV cache make me more vulnerable I 'm suspicious of hard drive cache especially when they cache data write You 're not stupid Smartdrive cache thing and Windows also run a swap file which may contain data also All of this be pretty risky stuff in a PC environment The straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the /f option to fix the disk and then it look like I would probably have to reinstall Windows and a few other thing A reasonably accurate prediction Here 's a brief description of how DOS store file : There be three piece to a file The directory entry the FAT chain and the data area You can think of these a a sheet of line notebook paper a sheet of graph paper and a stack of X card The directory entry notebook paper hold the file name actual size and first cluster number It also hold some other information that 's not important right now The File Allocation Table FAT chain graph paper tell where to find the actual data Each square of graph paper hold a number If the number be zero the cluster associate with this box be available If it hold a `` magic '' number it be either the last piece of a file or a bad unuseable spot on the disk Any other number tell which cluster contains the next section of the file The data area X card be where the actual information be store The data area be organize a cluster of a fix size storage be doled out in `` chunk '' of one cluster each In your case one cluster be byte As a cluster be fill another be allocate To read a file you first look at the directory entry to get the start cluster number Now you read the data from that cluster Next look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read This will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file Naturally these number be usually sequential but they can jump around and even go backwards Continue reading one cluster at a time a you walk this chain through the FAT until you hit the marker which say it 's the last cluster in the file CHKDSK be the DOS utility that check the sanity and coherence of the directory and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaw into submission It do n't have any intelligence so you have to double check anything it `` fix '' Now let 's do a bit of a post mortem : C : \\\\GFX\\\\VPIC\\\\CVPIC EXE C : \\\\GFX\\\\VPIC\\\\VPIC TXT C : \\\\GFX\\\\VPIC\\\\VIDEO CFG C : \\\\GFX\\\\VPIC\\\\ORCPRO CFG C : \\\\GFX\\\\VPIC\\\\VGA CFG C : \\\\GAME\\\\GOOSE\\\\BIRD X C : \\\\WINMISC\\\\ADV\\\\WINADV EXE Allocation error size adjust All of these file have size accord to the FAT which do n't match the size report in their directory entry CHKDSK /F will alter the directory entry to match the FAT size In other word the directory entry for CVPIC EXE may say the file be byte long But CHKDSK found a FAT chain of cluster attach to it My number obviously be make up lose allocation unit found in chain byte disk space would be freed Disk space be found which be allocate in the FAT but be not attach to any directory entry CHKDSK /F give you the option of convert these '' lose chain '' to file You can then examine the file FILE CHK through FILE CHK and rename or discard them Or if you tell CHKDSK _not_ to convert them to file then those cluster will simply be marked `` available '' in the FAT C : \\\\GFX\\\\VPIC\\\\CVPIC EXE Is cross link on allocation unit C : \\\\SPART PAR Is cross link on allocation unit These file be both reference the _same_ data cluster Obviously one of them at least must be wrong It 's interest to note that C : \\\\SPART PAR be your Windows swap file To fix this you should copy each cross link file to a new name This will `` fix '' the cross link by give the file unique data space Now delete the cross link file Examine the copy and try to assemble them properly Good luck Hint : `` Missing piece '' be likely to be found in those `` lose chain '' at the top byte total disk space byte in hidden file byte in directory byte in user file byte available on disk Your disk be pretty close to full This may be the actual cause of the problem perhaps Windows need to expand it swapfile by an amount which exceed available disk space In any case the short summary be that something trash your FAT There be utility that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage after something like this but you have to run them _before_ the problem

Engine from Borland Other product mention be : Microsoft 's ODBC Accsys Quadbase Codebase RBASE and QE Only ODBC Quadbase RBASE and QE have SQL For myself I decide on Codebase mostly because it have an ANSI C portability version that run under DOS UNIX etc and include the source code and portability be important in my application It work with DBASE FoxPro or Clipper file However I feel that Microsoft 's ODBC look very promising It 's mostly a formalisation of building and submit SQL query and format query result As the response say it 's available via ftp except it 's effectively unusuable without two manual : the `` ODBC Programmer 's Reference '' and the `` ODBC SDK Guide '' Moreover ODBC do n't actually interpret SQL and liase with database that 's up to driver that should be provide by database manufacturer Also it 's Windows only it 's actually an extension to the Windows SDK Nevertheless it 's a start at a SQL interface standard and should make life interest in the future Here 's my original post follow by the response separate by a line of asterisk Does anyone know if Borland or Microsoft have library for access their respective database Paradox FoxPro from within C program I 'd really like to be able to build a SQL query string and pas it to a function which return the query result in some format Failing that any other access would still be well than nothing I 'd also like to hear of third party library for do the same thing If other people be interested I 'll prepare a summary of what I'm told and post it Thanks to all Borland have a product call

this time and every time I post see the signature Due to demand and request here be some additional DMQS file I've collect for the XGA These file function with the late revision of the driver for the XGA Not all these file will work under Windows with the driver available to the general public at this time All file will function under the most recent OS/ beta and those I 've try have work under OS/ SP Not all file have be fully test THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED They represent a personal collection not anything resemble an officially support set As a standard disclaimer I would like to point out the follow fact : Some of these file may run your adapter out of spec Doing so can stress the ICs on the card and may result in incorrect operation or in shorter life how short depends on how much out of spec boom : Some of these file may run your adapter in a region that be out of spec for your monitor result in damage to your monitor You should be knowledgable about your monitor and adapter 's ability to use the mode you select Using these file represent hack in a very true sense so practice safe compute and do n't play around too much if you do n't like the risk and be n't knowledgable about what you 're do If you feel uncomfortable with all the warning use the DMQS file you have or wait until IBM release official test DMQS file Although you should be aware of warn even with the IBM file THESE FILES ARE UNSUPPORTED By use them you may invalidate your warrenty Not all have be fully test I do n't have that many monitor Installation : unpack in your DMQSPATH environment variable usually c : \\\\xgadmqs Then use the method described in your XGA installation diskette to change your adapter or setting Packing : these file have be packed with the late INFOZIP utility You will need PKZip x if you do n't have the INFOZIP utility Submitting : feel free to send me uuencoded version of your favorite DMQS file for your favorite monitor I 'm always interested in collect more

Then do n't complain maybe it be n't you that SCSI be so expensive on PC 's because all we 've have until a year or two ago be the ISA bus ie no one buy SCSI for ISA because ISA be slow Are you say that SCSI on an ISA bus be not an automatic winner when compare to IDE You do n't read to carefully VLB IDE us the same connection mechanism a standard IDE If transfer rate be limited by IDE whether it's interfaced to ISA EISA or VLB matter not I get different transfer rate out of my IDE when I change my ISA bus speed On mine for one thing SCSI blow IDE out of the water hand down If IDE have well throughput why be n't it use on workstation and file server IDE be just a variant of the old IBM MFM AT controller at least that's how it look from a software point of view It be never meant to be an all encompass protocal/standard to be implimented across different platform Is there any argument that IDE can or ca n't transfer data from the IDE drive at least a fast a the drive be able to provide the data Are SCSI version of IDE drive able to deliver high sustain transfer rate to their SCSI interface because of a high RPM platter different arrangement of head etc : Given the original question SCSI use only a a single hard drive : controller be it then necessary to get a SCSI drive that will do : at least maybe megs/sec for the SCSI choice to make any sence : What do a meg megs/sec SCSI drive cost No that 's the nice thing on a multitasking OS SCSI can use both drive at once I 've get unix load on one of my pc along with windogs and the OS can only use one of the two IDE drive at one time It 's pretty ugly If data be go from one drive to another and if SCSI have the ability to perform that transfer without the data have to go through the CPU or main memory then yes that be the optimal way to do it As far a I know IDE ca n't do that But when the CPU want data from both drive data to be store in main memory be you say that SCSI can grab data from both drive at the same time and store/transfer that data to main memory also at the same time Working off IRQ and DMA channel on an ISA or whatever bus I just bought at Quantum for my mac at home I paid for it I have n't see IDE drive cheaper A friend of mine just get a Maxtor meg IDE drive for that 's million byte or mega byte With the basic interface he get close to meg/sec transfer on his Does your figure include a few hundred for SCSI driver No actually we 're talk about SCSI be expensive simply because nobody do a common interface for the PC If they have a common read : easily implement method of add scsi to a PC like a in a Sun or Mac then you 'd find SCSI the connection medium of choice So you 're say that SCSI would have be the default interface type consider that the vast majority of PC 's do n't have cd rom drive or tape backup or etc That most PC 's only have or have hard drive and run DOS That SCSI hard drive cost a lot more than MFM or RLL drive at the time and how common be SCSI drive under meg to year ago There 's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that prevent SCSI from become the connection medium of choice : I wo n't argue that the SCSI standard make for a good well implimented : data highway but I still want to know why it intrinsically well : than IDE on an ISA bus when it come to multi task OS 's when : manage data from a single SCSI hard drive On a single drive SCSI be more expensive But on that point be it faster This be what all this be about Do you get more performance for the money For all the people that will only have a single hard drive in their system regardless of the OS will the SCSI choice really give them more performance than IDE But you bought your PC for expandibility so you 'd want to add more drive or whatever True but expandibility can also start on the bus which mean the option be there for cd rom drive or tape backup that run off their own card You can add many different type of device and access them concurrently No argument This be always held up to the first time SCSI buyer a the best reason But how many SCSI device will the first time SCSI buyer eventually acquire Again do it make sense to go SCSI for a single hard drive system A SCSI device work on many different machine I have a mac and a PC at home and move hard drive between them be VERY nice with SCSI hook them up and away they go With all the posting on the SCSI I or II spec be you really sure that PC and Apple SCSI hard drive be compatible And even if they be be the data accessible from either machine ie be there no formatting/ partition or file table difference Is it really plug ' n'play SCSI device work together well than IDE device For instance recently I add an old connor meg IDE to a maxtor meg IDE The connor MUST be setup a the slave It will work no other way On SCSI you set the address check the termination plug it in and away it go So the C : drive on the connor becomes a logical D : drive to DOS Is this really a problem I have a problem with IDE 's mutual exclusion I notice that the time it take to switch from access drive c : to drive d : be quite long a compare to the time it take to switch from drive c : to d : on a SCSI system Under a multitasking OS this be very noticable a many thing can be go on at once After have two IDE drive in my system for temporary file transfer I have never see any difference when switch

JPEG JPEG pronounce `` jay peg '' be a standardize image compression mechanism JPEG stand for Joint Photographic Experts Group the original name of the committee that write the standard JPEG be design for compress either full color or gray scale digital image of `` natural '' real world scene It do not work so well on non realistic image such a cartoon or line drawing JPEG do not handle black and white bit per pixel image nor do it handle motion picture compression Standards for compress those type of image be be work on by other committee name JBIG and MPEG respectively JPEG be `` lossy '' meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't quite identical to what you originally put in The algorithm achieves much of it compression by exploit know limitation of the human eye notably the fact that small color detail be n't perceive a well a small detail of light and dark Thus JPEG be intend for compress image that will be look at by human If you plan to machine analyze your image the small error introduce by JPEG may be a problem for you even if they be invisible to the eye A useful property of JPEG be that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjust compression parameter This mean that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality You can make extremely small file if you do n't mind poor quality this be useful for index image archive make thumbnail view or icon etc etc Conversely if you be n't happy with the output quality at the default compression set you can jack up the quality until you be satisfied and accept lesser compression Why use JPEG There be two good reason : to make your image file small and to store bit per pixel color data instead of bit per pixel data Making image file small be a big win for transmit file across network and for archive library of image Being able to compress a Mbyte full color file down to Kbytes or so make a big difference in disk space and transmission time If you be compare GIF and JPEG the size ratio be more like four to one More detail below If your view software do n't support JPEG directly you 'll have to convert JPEG to some other format for view or manipulate image Even with a JPEG capable viewer it take longer to decode and view a JPEG image than to view an image of a simpler format GIF for instance Thus use JPEG be essentially a time/space tradeoff : you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply It 's worth note that when network or phone transmission be involve the time saving from transfer a shorter file can be much great than the extra time to decompress the file I 'll let you do the arithmetic yourself The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF a a standard Usenet post format be that JPEG can store full color information : bits/pixel million color instead of or less or few color If you have only bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you Within a couple of year though bit GIF will look a obsolete a black and white MacPaint format do today Furthermore for reason detailed in section JPEG be far more useful than GIF for exchange image among people with widely vary color display hardware Hence JPEG be considerably more appropriate than GIF for use a a Usenet post standard When should I use JPEG and when should I stick with GIF JPEG be not go to displace GIF entirely for some type of image GIF be superior in image quality file size or both One of the first thing to learn about JPEG be which kind of image to apply it to As a rule of thumb JPEG be superior to GIF for store full color or gray scale image of `` realistic '' scene that mean scan photograph and similar material JPEG be superior even if you do n't have bit display hardware and it be a LOT superior if you do See section for detail GIF do significantly well on image with only a few distinct color such a cartoon and line drawing In particular large area of pixel that be all exactly the same color be compress very efficiently indeed by GIF JPEG ca n't squeeze these file a much a GIF do without introduce visible defect This sort of image be best kept in GIF form In particular single color border be quite cheap in GIF file but they should be avoid in JPEG file JPEG also have a hard time with very sharp edge : a row of pure black pixel adjacent to a row of pure white pixel for example Sharp edge tend to come out blur unless you use a very high quality set Again this sort of thing be not found in scan photograph but it show up fairly often in GIF file : border overlaid text etc The blurriness be particularly objectionable with text that 's only a few pixel high If you have a GIF with a lot of small size overlaid text do n't JPEG it Computer drawn image ray trace scene for instance usually fall between scan image and cartoon in term of complexity The more complex and subtly render the image the more likely that JPEG will do well on it The same go for semi realistic artwork fantasy drawing and such Plain black and white two level image should never be convert to JPEG You need at least about gray level before JPEG be useful for gray scale image It should also be note that GIF be lossless for gray scale image of up to level while JPEG be not If you have an exist library of GIF image you may wonder whether you should convert them to JPEG You will lose a little image quality if you do Section which argues that JPEG image quality be superior to GIF only applies if both format start from a full color original If you start from a GIF you 've already irretrievably lose a great deal of information JPEG can only make thing bad However the disk space saving may justify convert anyway This be a decision you 'll have to make for yourself If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG see section for hint Be prepared to leave some image in GIF format since some GIFs will not convert well How well do JPEG compress image Pretty darn well Here be some sample file size for an image I have handy a x full color image of a ship in a harbor The first three file be for comparison purpose the rest be create with the free JPEG software described in section B File Size in byte Comments ship ppm Original file in PPM format no compression bit or byte per pixel plus a few byte overhead ship ppm Z PPM file pass through Unix compress compress do n't accomplish a lot you 'll note Other text orient compressor give similar result ship gif Converted to GIF with ppmquant f ppmtogif Most of the saving be the result of lose color info : GIF save bits/pixel not See sec ship jpg cjpeg Q high useful quality set This be indistinguishable from the bit original at least to my nonprofessional eyeball ship jpg cjpeg Q default set You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original even with both on screen at once ship jpg cjpeg Q This have slight defect if you know what to look for you could tell it 's be JPEGed without see the original Still a good image quality a many recent posting in Usenet picture group ship jpg cjpeg Q JPEG 's characteristic `` blockiness '' becomes apparent at this set djpeg blocksmooth help some Still I 've see plenty of Usenet posting that be of poorer image quality than this ship jpgo cjpeg Q optimize optimize cut table overhead Blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or index purpose Note that this file be TINY : the compression ratio from the original be : In this case JPEG can make a file that 's a factor of four or five small than a GIF of comparable quality the Q file be every bit a good a the GIF well if you have a full color display This seem to be a typical ratio for real world scene What be good `` quality '' setting for JPEG Most JPEG compressor let you pick a file size v image quality tradeoff by select a quality set There seem to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these setting `` Quality `` do NOT mean `` keep of the information '' a some have claimed The quality scale be purely arbitrary it 's not a percentage of anything The name of the game in use JPEG be to pick the low quality set small file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original This set will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here be some rule of thumb The default quality set Q be very often the best choice This set be about the low you can go without expect to see defect in a typical image Try Q first if you see defect then go up Except for experimental purpose never go above Q say Q will produce a file two or three time a large a Q but of hardly any well quality If the image be less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to Q without objectionable degradation On the other hand you might need to go to a HIGHER quality set to avoid far degradation The second case seem to apply much of the time when convert GIFs to JPEG The default Q be about right for compress bit image but Q to be usually well for convert GIFs see section for more info If you want a very small file say for preview or index purpose and be prepared to tolerate large defect a Q set in the range of to be about right Q or so may be amuse a `` op art '' Note : the quality setting discuss in this article apply to the free JPEG software described in section B and to many program base on it Other JPEG implementation such a Image Alchemy may use a completely different quality scale Some program do n't even provide a numeric scale just '' high '' / '' medium '' / '' low '' style choice Where can I get JPEG software Most of the program described in this section be available by FTP If you do n't know how to use FTP see the FAQ article `` How to find source '' If you do n't have direct access to FTP read about ftpmail server in the same article That article appear regularly in news answer or you can get it by send e mail to mail server rtfm mit edu with '' send usenet/news answers/finding source '' in the body The `` Anonymous FTP List FAQ '' may also be helpful it 's usenet/news answers/ftp list/faq in the news answer archive NOTE : this list change constantly If you have a copy more than a couple month old get the late JPEG FAQ from the news answer archive A If you be look for `` can '' software viewer etc : The first part of this list be system specific program that only run on one kind of system If you do n't see what you want for your machine check out the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list Note that this list concentrate on free and shareware program that you can obtain over Internet but some commercial program be list too X Windows : John Bradley 's free XV version and up be an excellent viewer for JPEG GIF and other image format It 's available for FTP from export lcs mit edu or ftp ci upenn edu The file be call 'xv tar Z ' where be the version number currently it be locate in the 'contrib ' directory on export or the 'pub/xv ' directory at upenn XV reduces all image to bit internally which mean it 's not a real good choice if you have a bit display you 'll still get only bit color Also you should n't use XV to convert full color image to JPEG because they 'll get color quantize first But XV be a fine tool for convert GIF and other bit image to JPEG CAUTION : there be a glitch in version and earlier : be sure to check the `` save at normal size '' checkbox when save a JPEG file or the file will be blurry Another good choice for X Windows be John Cristy 's free ImageMagick package also available from export lcs mit edu file contrib/ImageMagick tar Z This package handle many image processing and conversion task The ImageMagick viewer handle bit display correctly for colormapped display it do well though slow color quantization than XV or the basic free JPEG software Both of the above be large complex package If you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli xloadimage support JPEG in it late release xloadimage be free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib/xloadimage tar Z xli be a variant version of xloadimage say by it fan to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original The current xli be indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to JPEG file because it have the IJG v decoder while xloadimage be use a hack over v The next xloadimage release will fix this xli be also free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib/xli tar Z Both program be say to do the right thing with bit display MS DOS : This cover plain DOS for Windows or OS/ program see the next heading One good choice be Eric Praetzel 's free DVPEG which view JPEG and GIF file The current version a be available by FTP from sunee uwaterloo ca file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpega zip This be a good basic viewer that work on either or / machine The user interface be not flashy but it 's functional Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer be Mohammad Rezaei 's Hiview The current version be available from Simtel and mirror site see NOTE below file msdos/graphics/hv zip Hiview require a or well CPU and a VCPI compatible memory manager QEMM and MAX work Windows and OS/ do not Hiview be currently the fast viewer for image that be no big than your screen For large image it scale the image down to fit on the screen rather than use panning/scrolling a most viewer do You may or may not prefer this approach but there 's no deny that it slows down load of large image considerably Note : installation be a bit tricky read the direction carefully A shareware alternative be ColorView for DOS This be easy to install than either of the two freeware alternative Its user interface be also much spiffier look although personally I find it harder to use more keystroke inconsistent behavior It be faster than DVPEG but a little slow than Hiview at least on my hardware For image large than screen size DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed and both be faster than Hiview The current version be available from Simtel and mirror site see NOTE below file msdos/graphics/dcview zip Requires a VESA graphic driver if you do n't have one look in vesadrv zip or vesa tsr zip from the same directory Many recent PCs have a built in VESA driver so do n't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains that the driver be miss A second shareware alternative be Fullview which have be kick around the net for a while but I do n't know any stable archive location for it The current rather old version be inferior to the above viewer anyway The author tell me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly and it will be submit to the Simtel archive at that time The well know GIF viewer CompuShow CSHOW support JPEG in it late revision a However CSHOW 's JPEG implementation be n't very good : it 's slow about half the speed of the above viewer and image quality be poor except on hi color display Too bad it 'd have be nice

viewer might not work on your particular machine If you ca n't get any of them to work you 'll need to use one of the follow conversion program to convert JPEG to GIF then view with your favorite GIF viewer If you have hi color hardware do n't use GIF a the intermediate format try to find a TARGA capable viewer instead VPIC be repute to do the right thing with hi color display The Independent JPEG

program described above inside a Windows DOS window The new entry be WinECJ which be free and EXTREMELY fast Version be available from ftp rahul net file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj zip Requires Windows and or more color mode This be a no frill viewer with the bad habit of hog the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality be noticeably bad than other viewer But it 's so fast you 'll use it anyway at least for preview JView be freeware fairly fast have good on line help and can write out the decompress image in Windows BMP format but it ca n't create new JPEG file and it do n't

JPEG format The current version be a big improvement over prior version Get it from sumex aim stanford edu file /info mac/app/jpeg view hqx Requires System and QuickTime On bit display JPEGView usually produce the best color image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewer JPEGView can view large image in much less memory than other Mac viewer in fact it's the only one that can deal with JPEG image much over x pixel on a typical MB Mac Given a large image JPEGView automatically scale it down to fit on the screen rather than present scroll bar like most other viewer You can zoom in on any desire portion though Some people like this behavior some do n't Overall JPEGView 's user interface be very well thought out GIFConverter a shareware image viewer/converter support JFIF and PICT/JPEG a well a GIF and several other image format The late version be Get it from sumex aim stanford edu file /info mac/art/gif/gif converter hqx Requires System or later GIFConverter be not well than JPEGView a a plain JPEG/GIF viewer but it have much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capability so you may find it worth it shareware fee if you do a lot of play around with image Also the new version of GIFConverter can load and save JFIF image without QuickTime so it be your best bet if your machine be too old to run QuickTime But it 's faster with QuickTime Note : If GIFConverter run out of memory try to load a large JPEG try convert the file to GIF with JPEG Convert then view the GIF version JPEG Convert a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utility be available from sumex aim stanford edu file /info mac/app/jpeg convert hqx This will run on any Mac but it only do file conversion not view You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer Previous version of this FAQ recommend Imagery JPEG v a JPEGGIF converter base on an old version of the IJG code If you be use this program you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert Apple 's free program PictPixie can view image in JFIF QuickTime JPEG and GIF format and can convert between these format You can get PictPixie from ftp apple com file dts/mac/quicktime/qt stuff/pictpixie hqx Requires QuickTime PictPixie be intend a a developer 's tool and it's really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime Some of it drawback be that it require lot of memory it produce relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a bit display and it have a relatively unfriendly user interface Worse PictPixie be an unsupported program meaning it have some minor bug that Apple do not intend to fix There be an old version of PictPixie call PICTCompressor float around the net If you have this you should trash it a it 's even buggier Also the QuickTime Starter Kit include a much clean up descendant of PictPixie call Picture Compressor Note that Picture Compressor be NOT free and may not be distribute on the net Storm Technology 's Picture Decompress be a free JPEG viewer/converter This rather old program be inferior to the above program in many way but it will run without System or QuickTime so you may be force to use it on old system It do need bit QuickDraw so really old machine can't use it You can get it from sumex aim stanford edu file /info mac/app/picture decompress hqx You must set the file type of a download image file to 'JPEG ' to allow Picture Decompress to open it If your machine be too old to run bit QuickDraw a Mac Plus for instance GIFConverter be your only choice for single program JPEG view If you do n't want to pay for GIFConverter use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer More and more commercial Mac application be support JPEG although not all can deal with the Usenet standard JFIF format Adobe Photoshop version or later can read and write JFIF format JPEG file use the JPEG plug in from the Acquire menu You must set the file type of a download JPEG file to 'JPEG ' to allow Photoshop to recognize it Amiga : Most program list in this section be store in the AmiNet archive at amiga physik unizh ch There be many mirror site of this archive and you should try to use the closest one In the USA a good choice be wuarchive wustl edu look under /mirrors/amiga physik unizh ch/ HamLab Plus be an excellent JPEG viewer/converter a well a be a general image manipulation tool It 's cheap shareware and can read several format besides JPEG The current version be A demo version be available from amiga physik unizh ch and mirror site file amiga/gfx/edit/hamlabd lha The demo version will crop image large than x but it be otherwise fully functional Rend shareware be an image renderer that can display JPEG ILBM and GIF image The program can be use to create animation even capture frame on the fly from render package like Lightwave The current version be available from amiga physik unizh ch and mirror site file amiga/os/gfx/rend lha Note : although this directory be supposedly for AmigaDOS program the program will also run under AmigaDOS or Viewtek be a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer The current version be available from amiga physik unizh ch and mirror site file amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek lha If you 're willing to spend real money there be several commercial package that support JPEG Two be write by Thomas Krehbiel the author of Rend and Viewtek These be CineMorph a standalone image morph package and ImageFX an impressive bit image capture conversion edit painting effect and prepress package that also include CineMorph Both be distribute by Great Valley Products Art Department Professional ADPro from ASDG Inc be the most widely use commercial image manipulation software for Amigas ImageMaster from Black Belt Systems be another well regard commercial graphic package with JPEG support The free IJG JPEG software be available compile for Amigas from amiga physik unizh ch and mirror site in directory amiga/gfx/conv file AmigaJPEGV lha These program convert JPEG to/from PPM GIF Targa format The Amiga world be heavily infest with quick and dirty JPEG program many base on an ancient beta test version of the free IJG JPEG software thanks to a certain magazine that publish same on it disk of the month without so much a notify the author Among these be `` AugJPEG '' `` NewAmyJPEG '' '' VJPEG '' and probably others I have not even heard of In my opinion anything old than IJG version March be not worth the disk space it 's store on if you have such a program trash it and get something newer Atari ST : The free IJG JPEG software be available compile for Atari ST TT etc from atari

must be one by now Pointers appreciate Acorn Archimedes : ChangeFSI supply with RISC OS version can convert from and view JPEG JFIF format Provision be also make to convert image to JPEG although this must be do from the CLI rather than by double click Recent version since of the shareware program Translator can handle JPEG along with about other image format While old version can be found on some Archimedes bboards the current version be only available by register with the author John Kortink Nutterbrink WJ Enschede The Netherlands Price Dutch guilder about or pound There 's also a commercial

organization if you 'd like to contribute to improve our software you be welcome to join What 's all this hoopla about color quantization Most people do n't have full color bit per pixel display hardware Typical display hardware store or few bit per pixel so it can display or few distinct color at a time To display a full color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative color This process be call `` color quantization '' This be something of a misnomer `` color selection '' would be a well term We 're stuck with the standard usage though Clearly color quantization be a lossy process It turn out that for most image the detail of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact on the final image quality than do any error introduce by JPEG except at the very low JPEG quality setting Since JPEG be a full color format convert a color JPEG image for display on bit or less hardware require color quantization This be true for all color JPEGs : even if you feed a or less color GIF into JPEG what come out of the decompressor be not color but thousand of color This happens because JPEG 's lossiness affect each pixel a little differently so two pixel that start with identical color will probably come out with slightly different color Each original color get `` smear '' into a group of nearby color Therefore quantization be always require to display a color JPEG on a colormapped display regardless of the image source The only way to avoid quantization be to ask for gray scale output Incidentally because of this effect it 's nearly meaningless to talk about the number of color use by a JPEG image Even if you attempt to count the number of distinct pixel value different JPEG decoder would give you different result because of roundoff error difference I occasionally see post image described a `` color JPEG '' This tell me that the poster a have n't read this FAQ and b probably convert the JPEG from a GIF JPEGs can be classify a color or gray scale just like photograph but number of color just be n't a useful concept for JPEG On the other hand a GIF image by definition have already be quantize to or few color A GIF do have a definite number of color in it palette and the format do n't allow more than palette entry For purpose of Usenet picture distribution GIF have the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipient do n't have to This be also the disadvantage of GIF : you 're stuck with the sender's quantization If the sender quantize to a different number of color than what you can display you have to re quantize result in much poorer image quality than if you have quantize once from a full color image Furthermore if the sender do n't use a high quality color quantization algorithm you 're out of luck For this reason JPEG offer the promise of significantly well image quality for all user whose machine do n't match the sender 's display hardware JPEG 's full color image can be quantize to precisely match the user 's display hardware Furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvement in quantization algorithm there be a lot of active research in this area or purchase well display hardware to get a well view of JPEG image you already have With a GIF you 're stuck forevermore with what be sent It 's also worth mention that many GIF view program include rather shoddy quantization routine If you view a color GIF on a color EGA display for example you be probably get a much bad image than you need to This be partly an inevitable consequence of do two color quantization one to create the GIF one to display it but often it's also due to sloppiness JPEG conversion program will be force to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable result at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of color to be displayed Thus JPEG be likely to provide well result than the average GIF program for low color resolution display a well a high resolution one Finally an ever grow number of people have well than bit display hardware already : bit `` hi color '' PC display true bit display on workstation and Macintoshes etc For these people GIF be already obsolete a it can not represent an image to the full capability of their display JPEG image can drive these display much more effectively Thus JPEG be an all around well choice than GIF for represent image in a machine independent fashion How do JPEG work The buzz word to know be chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and Huffman or arithmetic entropy cod This article 's long enough already so I 'm not go to say more than that here For technical information see the comp compression FAQ This be available from the news answer archive at rtfm mit edu in file /pub/usenet/news answers/compression faq/part If you need help in use the news answer archive see the top of this article What about lossless JPEG There 's a great deal of confusion on this subject The JPEG committee do define a truly lossless compression algorithm i e one that guarantee the final output be bit for bit identical to the original input However this lossless mode have almost nothing in common with the regular lossy JPEG algorithm and it offer much less compression At present very few implementation of lossless JPEG exist and all of them be commercial Saying `` Q `` to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image What it do get rid of be deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step There be still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step With the V free JPEG code you can also say '' sample x '' to turn off subsampling Keep in mind that many commercial JPEG implementation can not cope with the result file Even with both quantization and subsampling turn off the regular JPEG algorithm be not lossless because it be subject to roundoff error in various calculation The maximum error be a few count in any one pixel value it 's highly unlikely that this could be perceive by the human eye but it might be a concern if you be do machine processing of an image At this minimum loss set regular JPEG produce file that be perhaps half the size of an uncompressed bit per pixel image True lossless JPEG provide roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantee bit for bit accuracy If you have an application require lossless storage of image with less than bit per pixel per color component you may want to look into the JBIG bilevel image compression standard This performs well than JPEG lossless on such image JPEG lossless be superior to JBIG on image with or more bit per pixel furthermore JPEG be public domain at least with a Huffman back end while the JBIG technique be heavily cover by patent Why all the argument about file format Strictly speak JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithm it do not refer to a specific image file format The JPEG committee be prevent from define a file format by turf war within the international standard organization Since we ca n't actually exchange image with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaf u with a problem In the absence of official standard a number of JPEG program writer have just go off to '' do their own thing '' and a a result their program be n't compatible with anybody else 's The closest thing we have to a de facto standard JPEG format be some work that 's be coordinate by people at C Cube Microsystems They have define two JPEG base file format : JFIF JPEG File Interchange Format a `` low end '' format that transport pixel and not much else TIFF/JPEG aka TIFF an extension of the Aldus TIFF format TIFF be a `` high end '' format that will let you record just about everything you ever want to know about an image and a lot more besides : TIFF be a lot more complex than JFIF and may well prove less transportable because different vendor have historically implement slightly different and incompatible subset of TIFF It 's not likely that add JPEG to the mix will do anything to improve this situation Both of these format be developed with input from all the major vendor of JPEG related product it 's reasonably likely that future commercial product will adhere to one or both standard I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF a the replacement for GIF in picture posting JFIF be simpler than TIFF and be available now the TIFF spec have only recently be officially adopt and it be still unusably vague on some crucial detail Even when TIFF/JPEG be well define the JFIF format be likely to be a widely support `` low common denominator '' TIFF/JPEG file may never be a transportable A particular case that people may be interested in be Apple 's QuickTime software for the Macintosh QuickTime us a JFIF compatible format wrap inside the Mac specific PICT structure Conversion between JFIF and QuickTime JPEG be pretty straightforward and several Mac program be available to do it see Mac portion of section A If you have an editor that handle binary file you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF by hand see section for detail Another particular case be Handmade Software 's program GIFJPG/JPGGIF and Image Alchemy These program be capable of reading and write JFIF format By default though they write a proprietary format developed by HSI This format be NOT readable by any non HSI program and should not be use for Usenet posting Use the j switch to get JFIF output This applies to old version of these program the current release emit JFIF format by default You still should be careful not to post HSI format file unless you want to get flame by people on non PC platform How do I recognize which file format I have and what do I do about it If you have an allege JPEG file that your software wo n't read it 's likely to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG base format You can tell what you have by inspect the first few byte of the file : A JFIF standard file will start with the character hex FF D FF E follow by two variable byte often hex follow by 'JFIF ' If you see FF D at the start but not the rest of it you may have a `` raw JPEG '' file This be probably decodable a be by JFIF software it 's worth a try anyway HSI file start with 'hsi ' You 're out of luck unless you have HSI software Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data but they wo n't decompress properly with non HSI program A Macintosh PICT file if JPEG compress will have a couple hundred byte of header follow by a JFIF header scan for 'JFIF ' Strip off everything before the FF D and you should be able to read it Anything else : it 's a proprietary format or not JPEG at all If you be lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream look for FF D try strip off everything before that In uuencoded Usenet posting the characteristic JFIF pattern be '' begin '' line M_C_X whereas uuencoded HSI file will start with '' begin '' line M : ' I If you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of download non JFIF file What about arithmetic cod The JPEG spec defines two different `` back end '' module for the final output of compress data : either Huffman cod or arithmetic cod be allow The choice have no impact on image quality but arithmetic cod usually produce a small compress file On typical image arithmetic cod produce a file or percent small than Huffman cod All the file size number previously cite be for Huffman cod Unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic cod specify by the JPEG standard be subject to patent own by IBM ATT and Mitsubishi Thus you can not legally use arithmetic cod unless you obtain license from these company The `` fair use '' doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually store any image with it be dubious at best At least in the short run I recommend that people not worry about arithmetic cod the space saving be n't great enough to justify the potential legal hassle In particular arithmetic cod should not be use for any image to be exchange on Usenet There be some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future Stay tune for far detail Does loss accumulate with repeat compression/decompression It would be nice if have compress an image with JPEG you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any far image degradation beyond what you lose initially Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE In general recompressing an alter image loses more information though usually not a much a be lose the first time around The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without change it then there be no far loss i e you get an identical JPEG file Even this be not true at least not with the current free JPEG software It 's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error If you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible change from the first generation output It usually take many such cycle to get visible change One of the thing on our to do list be to see if accumulation of error can be avoid or limited but I be not optimistic about it In any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compress the unmodified full color output of djpeg at the original quality set would introduce no far loss Even such simple change a crop off a border could cause far roundoff error degradation If you 're wonder why it 's because the pixel block boundary move If you cropped off only multiple of pixel you might be safe but that 's a mighty limited capability The bottom line be that JPEG be a useful format for archival storage and transmission of image but you do n't want to use it a an intermediate format for sequence of image manipulation step Use a lossless format PPM RLE TIFF etc while work on the image then JPEG it when you be ready to file it away Aside from avoid degradation you will save a lot of compression/decompression time this way : What be some rule of thumb for convert GIF image to JPEG As state earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an exist GIF image to JPEG If you can obtain the original full color data the GIF be make from it 's far well to make a JPEG from that But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from here be some suggestion for get maximum space saving with minimum loss of quality The first rule when convert a GIF library be to look at each JPEG to make sure you be happy with it before throw away the correspond GIF that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a high quality set if necessary Some GIFs may be well left a GIFs a explain in section in particular cartoon type GIFs with sixteen or few color do n't convert well You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality will be large than the GIF So check the size too Experience to date suggests that large high visual quality GIFs be the best candidate for conversion to JPEG They chew up the most storage so offer the most potential saving and they convert to JPEG with least degradation Do n't waste your time convert any GIF much under Kbytes Also don't expect JPEG file convert from GIFs to be a small a those create directly from full color original To maintain image quality you may have to let the convert file be a much a twice a big a straight through JPEG file would be i e shoot for / or /rd the size of the GIF file not /th a suggest in earlier comparison Many people have developed an odd habit of put a large constant color border around a GIF image While useless this be nearly free in term of storage cost in GIF file It be NOT free in JPEG file and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifact `` ghost '' edge Do yourself a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing If you be on an X Windows system XV 's manual and automatic crop function be a very painless way to do this cjpeg 's default Q set of be appropriate for full color input but for GIF input Q setting of to often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation If you apply smooth a suggest below the high Q set may not be necessary Color GIFs of photograph or complex artwork be usually `` dither '' to fool your eye into see more than the color that GIF can actually store If you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixel be often of significantly different color at normal size the eye average these pixel together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value The trouble with dither be that to JPEG it look like high spatial frequency color noise and JPEG ca n't compress noise very well The result JPEG file be both large and of low image quality than what you would have gotten from JPEGing the original full color image if you have it To get around this you want to `` smooth '' the GIF image before compression Smoothing average together nearby pixel thus approximate the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process get rid of the rapid color change that give JPEG trouble Appropriate use of smooth will often let you avoid use a high Q factor thus far reduce the size of the compress file while still obtain a well look output image than you 'd get without smooth With the V free JPEG software or product base on it a simple smooth capability be built in Try `` smooth `` or so when convert GIFs Values of to seem to work well for high quality GIFs Heavy hand dither may require large smooth factor If you can see regular fine scale pattern on the GIF image even without enlargement then strong smooth be definitely call for Too large a smooth factor will blur the output image which you do n't want If you be an image processing wizard you can also do smooth with a separate filter program such a pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package However cjpeg 's built in smoother be a LOT faster than pnmconvol The upshot of all this be that `` cjpeg quality smooth `` be probably a good start point for convert GIFs But if you really care about the image you 'll want to check the result and maybe try a few other setting For more information about JPEG in general or the
